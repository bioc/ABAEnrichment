Description: The package ABAEnrichment is designed to test for
        enrichment of user defined candidate genes in the set of
        expressed genes in different human brain regions. The core
        function 'aba_enrich' integrates the expression of the
        candidate gene set (averaged across donors) and the structural
        information of the brain using an ontology, both provided by
        the Allen Brain Atlas project. 'aba_enrich' interfaces the
        ontology enrichment software FUNC to perform the statistical
        analyses. Additional functions provided in this package like
        'get_expression' and 'plot_expression' facilitate exploring the
        expression data. From version 1.3.5 onwards genomic regions 
        can be provided as input, too; and from version 1.5.9 onwards
        the function 'get_annotated_genes' offers an easy way to obtain
        annotations of genes to enriched or user-defined brain regions.
