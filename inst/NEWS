CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.6
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

	o Add figure to vignette describing the FWER calculation 
	  for the hypergeometric test.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.5
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

	o The new option 'gene_len' creates random sets for the FWER 
	  of the hypergeometric test dependent on the gene lengths.

	o In addition to explicitly naming the candidate genes,
	  it is now possible to define entire genomic regions
	  as candidate and background regions. 
	  The names of the 'genes' vector have to be 
	  of the form 'chr:start-stop' to use this option.

	o The background regions by default are independent.
	  But using the option 'circ_chrom = TRUE', background 
	  regions on the same chromosome as the candidate region
	  are used and random candidate regions are allowed to
	  overlap multiple background regions.
	  
SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL CHANGES
	  
	o cutoff-quantiles are now computed using all protein coding
	  genes and not just input candidate and background genes.  


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.4
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

	o functions get_name, get_superstructures and 
	  get_sampled_substructures now also accept structure-IDs 
	  without the "Allen:"-prefix as input 
	  (like data are provided in ABAData-package).


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.3
------------------------

BUG FIXES

	o fixed error in get_expression(..., dataset="5_stages")- 
	  message ("returning log2(RPKM)" to "returning RPKM").
