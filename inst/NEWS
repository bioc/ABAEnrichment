CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.9
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

	o New function get_annotated_genes returns genes annotated 
	  to enriched or user-defined brain regions
	  
	o New function get_id returns the ID of a brain region 
	  given its name


USER-LEVEL CHANGES

	o results from aba_enrich get sorted on 
	  times_FWER_under_0.05 followed by min_FWER and mean_FWER
	  (order of min and mean switched)
	 
	o genes in aba_enrich(...)[[2]] are sorted alphabetically

	o when genomic regions are provided as input, candidate
	  regions are implicitly also part of the background
	  for the randomsets
	  (like it is for single-genes-input)


	  
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.8
------------------------

IMPROVEMENTS

	o Use dynamic tolerance for FWER calculation

	o Added more tests and checks

	o Improved checking of arguments when genomic regions are
